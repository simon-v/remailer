Good time-of-the-day, person.

According to my records, you (%s) subscribed to the %%NAME%% newsletter on %s via %s. A verification message was sent to your email, containing instructions for activating your subscription. If you didn't get it, you could try re-requesting it by going through the subscription procedure again (that is, sending an email with the subject "subscribe" to <%%LIST_ID%%-request@%%DOMAIN%%.com>).

If you have changed your mind, and would like to permanently remove your email from my records, please send an email with the subject "unsubscribe" instead, or simply wait. Unconfirmed subscriptions time out eventually.

Regards,
The %%NAME%% newsletter subscription management script.
